## Spectral fitting

This repository contains the needed codes to fitting star spectra as part of Atmosferas Estelares course. 

## How to run the programme

The deafult mode for the execution if the automatic. This mode analyzes the entire spectra list. 

For an indvidual fitting '-m' should be pass as argument at command line. Then, some argumens as the smoothing parameter and the iteration number should be passed by the user using the command line when required. 

For a semiautomática mode in which the user wants to select an specific spectrum, the parameter is -e.
